# pcb

PCB design. The files marked with "original" show the PCB that we ordered with the PMOS footprint mismatch as described in our report.

The current layout and schematic contain the updated PCB with the mismatch fixed. To produce the current PCB, use corrected_gerberdrill.zip when ordering from JLBPCB.
